This project is a small 2D game with minilibx. You'll learn about textures, sprites and tiles.

Itâ€™s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project!

**so long** will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management,
event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.

You are going to use the school graphical library: the **MiniLibX!** This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
